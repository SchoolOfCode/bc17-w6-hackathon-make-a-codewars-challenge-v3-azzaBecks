// Hello, this is a simple boolean Riddle-based challenge: "I'm tall when I'm young, and I'm short when I'm old. What am I?"
    // Your task is to write a function named `solveRiddle`
    // The function should take a single parameter 'answer' 
    // It should return with the parameter with a strict equality (===) followed by your answer wrapped in a string.
        // e.g. export function solveRiddle(answer) {
        //          return answer === "";
        //        }
    // Enter your "one word" answer within the string:
    // make sure you have inputted npm run test in the terminal to check your answer.
    // check the clue.md file if you need help LOL.
    // DO NOT GO INTO THE main.test.js FILE, UNLESS YOU HAVE ANSWERED CORRECTLY OR GIVEN UP (ANSWER REVEALED)
